Hi, I'm Lennart Kiil –

Welcome to my book about the great coronavirus pandemic of 2020 - it is very much a work in progress.

I've been working on this book idea for a while. I also write about the coronavirus pandemic for my publication in Danish, but due to the unfolding nature of this whole thing there are many things I cannot write about now – that should not go forgotten either.
