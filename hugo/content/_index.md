Hi, I'm Lennart Kiil –

Welcome to my book about the great coronavirus pandemic of 2020 - it is very much a work in progress.

I've been working on this book idea for a while. I also write about the coronavirus pandemic for my publication in Danish, but due to the unfolding nature of this whole thing there are many things I cannot write about now – that should not go forgotten either.

I have a background in biology and science writing. And for the last several years, I have been working with the relation between citizens and the state. I am using this experience in writing the book about the coronavirus catastrophe.
