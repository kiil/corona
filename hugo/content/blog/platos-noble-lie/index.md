## Authorities in the West have been lying about face masks {.pull .f2 .f1-m .f-subheadline-l .lh-title-l}

Early february I realized that authorities were lying. They were lying about something very important.

By _lying_ I really mean lying. Not just misinformation, but lies. They were telling people things _they must have known_ to be untrue.

Why would authorities lie? That will be the subject for another post.


To cover up for bad planning â€“ that is my best guess at the moment. I believe that this is at least part of the explanation.
