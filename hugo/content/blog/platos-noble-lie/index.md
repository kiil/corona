## Authorities in the West have been lying about face masks {.pull .f2 .f1-m .f-subheadline-l .lh-title-l}

Early february I realized that authorities were lying. They were lying about something very important.

By _lying_ I really mean lying. Not just misinformation, but lies. They were telling people things _they must have known_ to be untrue.

Why would authorities lie? That will be the subject for another post.


To cover up for bad planning â€“ that is my best guess at the moment. I believe that this is at least part of the explanation.

Platos noble lie may partly explain why authorities did not tell the truth about face masks.

But it does not explain why authorities did not trust the people to understand that health and care workers in the front line had the biggest need for face masks.

People would have understood that.

Now everybody is in a worse position and precious time have been wasted.
